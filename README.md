# GuessABox
A jQuery based GuessABox game.

On a 5x5 grid, two users will take turns selecting cells on the grid. When a randomly selected cell is clicked, the winner user will be announced. A ding sound will also be played upon a user winning the game.

This project was made as a demonstration for a UK competition in the field of Web Design.
